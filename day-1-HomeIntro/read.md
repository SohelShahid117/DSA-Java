DSA Home & Introduction:https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/index.php

1.The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.
2.In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures:

2a.Primitive Data Structures: are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

2b.Abstract Data Structures: are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

3.what is algorithm?: An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.
4.When we talk about algorithms in Computer Science, the step-by-step instructions are written in a programming language, and instead of food ingredients, an algorithm uses data structures.
5.Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand.Data structures is like a family tree.

6.By understanding DSA, you can::
    Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.
    Make programs that run faster or use less memory.
    Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.


7.What is algorithm? :A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.
8.What is Data Structure? :A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.

9.what is Time Complexity? :A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
10.Space Complexity?:A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

11.Big O Notation? :A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.
12.Recursion? :A programming technique where a function calls itself.

13.Divide and Conquer? :A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.
14.Brute Force? :A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.
